This is scripts and patches used to build the AVR Tools PND.
The workflow is:
- get-sources.sh outside dchrt (with git)
- sudo-prep-build.sh as root in dchrt
- build.sh (as builder in dchrt)
- build-libc-doc.sh outside dchrt (if the docs are needed)
- cleanup.sh (in dchrt)
- prep-pnd.sh (in dchrt)
- make-pnd.sh outside dchrt (because mksquashfs -comp xz, also performance)

The PND contains a file versions.txt that contains the hashes/revisions of 
the repos that the pnd was built from, including this repo. But in case
of any issues, there is also a tarball of the src dir per pnd version:

- 1.3.0.*:  https://urjaman.ddns.net/avr-tools-src-170716.tar.xz

The scripts here can also be used to build "personal" AVR 
toolchain setups, for that:
- arch-deps.sh installs the dependencies needed on arch linux (good hints for others too)
- edit paths-cfg to put the PREFIX somewhere saner, like your home dir
- uncomment the exit 0 in build.sh to skip git and make
