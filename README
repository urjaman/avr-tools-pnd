This is scripts and patches used to build the AVR Tools PND.
The workflow is:
- get-sources.sh outside dchrt (with subversion and git)
- sudo-prep-build.sh as root in dchrt
- build.sh (as builder in dchrt)
- cleanup.sh
- prep-pnd.sh
- make-pnd.sh outside dchrt (because mksquashfs -comp xz, also performance)

The PND contains a file versions.txt that contains the hashes/revisions of 
the repos that the pnd was built from, including this repo. But in case
of any issues, there is also a tarball of the src dir per pnd version:

- 1.3.0.*:  https://urjaman.ddns.net/avr-tools-src-170716.tar.xz
