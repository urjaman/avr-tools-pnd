Hi, some quick specifics of the PND
---

Here, ~ is not your home but the PND directory, that is $HOME for the pnd.

~/src
--
aka /mnt/utmp/avrtools/src is a directory for you to add your projects.

~/udev-rules
--
This directory has udev rules for using some Atmel programmer devices
(AVR Dragon, JTAGICEMKII, AVRISP mkII, AVR ICE) as a normal user.
To install* them:
$Â cd ~/udev-ruls
$ sudo ./install.sh 

(If you plugged in your USB device before installing the rules, re-plug it.)
(* This is a one time thing that places a small file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ )

This isnt specific to this PND, but i thought a quick usage help would be useful.
This is for the Atmel ICE and a PDI device (an xmega) since that is what i have.
Image you're in your project directory, have flashed the device with some fw that you
have the elf binary for there, and want to debug it.

$ avarice -4 -X 127.0.0.1:4242 &
$ avr-gdb some.elf
(gdb) target remote :4242

Use avarice --help for more parameters, but these used were:
-4, --edbg                  Atmel-ICE, or JTAGICE3 (firmware 3.x), or EDBG Integrated Debugger
-X, --pdi                   AVR part is an ATxmega device, using PDI.

And 127.0.0.1:4242 was [[HOST_NAME]:PORT] for the avarice server to listen on, you
can omit the IP if you want it to listen on any interface.

git
--
Git has been patched to ignore chmod failures (FAT stuff), and
we ship an etc/gitconfig to have it ignore executable bits (more FAT stuff)
and use links and the html help files for documentation/help.
The default config commands use ~/.gitconfig and i suggest you use
that for setting your name & email as usual.
